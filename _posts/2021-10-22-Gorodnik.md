Abstract: We explore the behaviour of the counting function which represents the number of solutions
of a multiplicative Diophantine problem. The argument is based on analysis of measures translated
under a group action on homogeneous spaces. Ultimately we explain how estimates on correlations
of translated measures lead to a quantitative asymptotic formula for the counting function.
This is a joint work with Bj√∂rklund and Fregolli.
