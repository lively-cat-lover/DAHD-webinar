Abstract: Consider a shrinking neighborhood of a cusp of the unit tangent bundle of a noncompact hyperbolic surface of finite area.  We discuss how a closed horocycle whose length goes to infinity can become equidistributed on this shrinking neighborhood, giving a sharp criterion in a natural case. This setup is closely related to number theory, and, as an example, our method yields a number-theoretic identity.
