Abstract: The Siegel transform is one of the main tools when we consider
problems related to counting lattice points using homogeneous dynamics. It
is revealed by many mathematicians that Siegel’s integral formula and
Rogers’ second moment formula are very useful to solve various
quantitative and effective variants of classical problems in the geometry
of numbers, such as the Gauss circle problem (generalized to convex sets)
and Oppenheim conjecture. Furthermore, Rogers’ higher moment formulas,
together with the method of moments, give us information about limit
distributions related to these problems.
In this talk, we revisit Rogers’ higher moment formulas with a new
approach, and introduce higher moment formulas for Siegel transforms on
the space of affine unimodular lattices and the space of unimodular
lattices with a congruence condition. Using these formulas, we obtain the
results of limit distributions, which are generalizations of the work of
Rogers (1956), Södergren (2011), and Strömbergsson and Södergren (2019).
This is joint work with Mahbub Alam and Anish Ghosh.
